This folder contains the code and data for a real estate price prediction and classification problem presented in my MSc Applications of Machine Learning Module.
The task here was to create a ML model which can determine the classifcation of a real estate price as expensive vs. not expensive, as well as to perform
regression to predict a houses price.
