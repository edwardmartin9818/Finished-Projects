This folder contains the .ipynb file for a machine learning project completed as part of a group in my MSc Applications of Machine LEarning module.
The aim of the project was to create a machine learning model capable of performing sentiment analysis of a dataset to detect positive, negative or neither sentiment 
split across 5 classes of data. The core responsibilies of the project were split across 3 pairs of people within the team. Myself and my partner were responsible for the 
implementation of the model and feature creation. 

The features constructed consisted of word/token n-grams and were fed into a Bidirection Long Short-Term Memory network.
A number of packages were used including NLTK, Keras and SKLearn. For learning purposes the Pandas package was not utilised.
