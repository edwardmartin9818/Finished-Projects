This folder contains the code and data for a text classification problem presented in my MSc Applications of Mahcine Learning Module.
This task here was to creat an ML model which can determine the classifcation of input text as a news artcile relating to business, sport, 
entertainment, politics or tech. The data provided also needed to be crafted into usable features. The final implementation used n-gram features, input article length and
bag-of-words representation as input features, and a SVM classifier.
